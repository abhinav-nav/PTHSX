#Python script that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques for website malware detection:
"""" In this more advanced script, the following techniques are employed:

Fetches the website content using the requests library.
Extracts the text content from the HTML using BeautifulSoup.
Loads a pre-trained machine learning model for malware detection from a specified URL.
Preprocesses the text content using a tokenizer and performs padding on the sequences.
Predicts the probability of the website being malware using the loaded model.
Classifies the website based on the predicted probability.
Please ensure that you provide a valid model file URL (model_url) where the machine learning model for malware detection is hosted. Additionally, adjust the script to accommodate the specific requirements of your machine learning model.

It's important to note that developing an accurate and reliable machine learning model for malware detection requires a large and diverse dataset, as well as ongoing model training and updates to keep up with evolving malware patterns. 
The provided script serves as a basic example and may require customization and further enhancements based on your specific needs and the complexity of the malware detection task."""
