'''Python script that incorporates advanced security techniques for website scanning and vulnerability assessment:
This advanced script introduces the following additional security measures:

Parallelized scanning of links using the ThreadPoolExecutor for faster vulnerability assessment.
Integration with the Vulners vulnerability database using the vulners library to scan the website for known vulnerabilities.
Displaying vulnerabilities found for each link on the website.
Additional security checks and analysis (to be implemented based on your specific requirements).
Make sure to replace 'your_vulners_api_key' with your own API key obtained from the Vulners vulnerability database.

Keep in mind that security is a complex and continuous process. This script provides a starting point for website scanning and vulnerability assessment, 
but it's important to adapt and expand it based on your specific security needs. Consider incorporating techniques like input validation, output encoding, authentication and authorization, secure session management, secure configuration, error handling, logging, and more.
