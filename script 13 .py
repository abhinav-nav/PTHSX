'''Python script that incorporates various security measures to enhance the security of a website:
This advanced script includes the following security measures:

Fetches the website content using the requests library.
Extracts links from the website content using BeautifulSoup.
Calculates the MD5 hash of the website content to ensure data integrity.
Encrypts sensitive data using the cryptography library and Fernet encryption.
Performs additional security checks and analysis (to be implemented based on your specific requirements).
Please note that the provided script is a starting point, and you should adapt and expand it to fit your specific security needs. Consider incorporating techniques like input validation, output encoding, authentication and authorization, secure session management, secure configuration, error handling, logging, and more.

Remember that security is a continuous process, and it's crucial to stay updated with the latest security best practices and vulnerabilities. Regularly review and improve your website's security measures, and consider utilizing security tools and frameworks to enhance the overall security of your website.
